### Instructions for Running the 6-DOF Robot Kinematics Simulation

1. **Start the Simulation**: 
   Begin by running the `startup_rvc.m` script. This will initialize the necessary environment for the simulation.

2. **Execute the Kinematics Task**: 
   After initialization, run the `Task5.m` script. This script allows you to explore and interact with the forward kinematics and joint parameters of the defined 6-DOF robot.
