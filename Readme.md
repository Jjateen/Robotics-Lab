# Robotics Course @ IIITN

This repository contains all of my work during the Robotics course at IIITN. Throughout this course, I have worked on various tasks, some focusing on Reinforcement Learning.

Note: While my work for Task 1 and Task 2 involved experimenting with Reinforcement Learning in Webots, the actual objectives were to create a custom environment for Task 1 and to model your own 4WD robot for Task 2.
